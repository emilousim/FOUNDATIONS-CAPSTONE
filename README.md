 ## Description

  *The what, why, and how:*

  This website is designed to show and provide information on a pet rescue, titled here "Fierce Feline Rescue". Amongst a variety of other cool elements, this program can take in user input for an adoption application and store it in a database hosted on heroku's pgweb, making applying to adopt simple for both the applicant and those reviewing the application.

  ## Installation

  *Steps required to install project and how to get the development environment running:*

  In order to run this application yourself, you'll follow a couple of different steps. To generate and copy the files, you'll need to run 'git clone' + the project's github link (found under the green button labelled 'code' in 
the right hand corner of the project's folder) in your machine's terminal. After this is finished, all you need to do is run "npm install" in order to install the npm package dependencies as specified in the package.json: axios, express, cors, dotenv, nodemon, pg, pg-hstore, and sequelize. Once all of this is complete, you're ready to start accepting those applications!

  ## Usage

  *Instructions and examples for use:*

  To submit an application, navigate to the webpage by opening the index.html file as well as starting your server by running npm start. Click the button in the top right hand corner labelled "Adopt Today". Once you click that, 
you're brought to a separate page containing the application. Fill this out, and the application will be sent to the database!
